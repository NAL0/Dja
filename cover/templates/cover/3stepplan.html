	<h1 class="cover-heading">New Age Liberty</h1>
	<p>New Age liberty is an informal non-profit organisation created to achieve the goal of African unity in our lifetime.
<br><br>
The first step in our plan (to achieve African unity) is to work with the people of Africa to reduce hunger and poverty in the poorest areas, thus working to realizing the 2030 goals set in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.
<br><br>
The second step will be to work with the people in devoping a strong intra-African sharing economy (led by the spirit of Ubuntu) to reduce inequality in Africa, beginning the process uniting Africa economically and bringing us closer to meeting of the goals set in the 2063 agenda for sustainable development.
<br><br>
In a maturing sharing economy the poorest of Africa's people shall have greater access to the facilities previously available only to the privileged (Facilities like quality education, internet access, adequate housing, running water, electricity, transportation etc). This will allow Africa to take step of aligning government policy and legislature in order to unite politically, allowing the dissolution of colonial boarders and forming The United People's Republic of Africa.
